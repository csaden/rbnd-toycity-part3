How long did you spend working on this project?

I spent about an hour and a half on this project. I have prior experience
coding with JavaScript and Python. I found much of the information to be easy to
pick up from my experiences coding in Python. Object-oriented programming principles
are the same between Python and Ruby; I needed to learn the Ruby syntax and Ruby
-way of coding classes.

What was the most rewarding challenge you conquered?

I have a better understanding of class methods, public methods, private methods,
and protected methods. I've always wondered about the differences between them,
and I now understand how and why I might use the different methods.


What two additional features did you build? Why?

I added purchase amounts to customers, incrementing the total number of purchases
a customer makes with each transaction that successfully occurs.

I also added some additional search functionalities: finding all transactions
for a given product title and finding all transactions for a given customer name.

Where do you still have room to grow?

I probably need more experience working with classes and understanding how classes
should interact. It seems a little bit odd to me that I would call class methods from
within other classes. The coupling might be too strong, which can lead to harder
to maintain code. I'd also like to continue working with error classes, raising
errors, and catching errors.
